# DOWNFALL

### Theme

Confidence is plummeting as the British economy crashes to the ground. Exchange the falling currency before it loses all its value!

### Tips

DOWNFALL has no winners. But if you achieve the high score, you will learn the message of DOWNFALL.

### Keys

*A* rotate anticlockwise  
*B* rotate clockwise  
*<* move left  
*>* move right  
*Shift* soft drop

### Mechanics

Simple scoring as per the [original BPS](https://tetris.wiki/Scoring), except there are no bonus points for hard drop, as only soft drop is implemented. The rotation system also is similar to the original, with the exception that the I tetromino has 4 positions rather than 2. Single preview. Wall kicks, no floor kicks, fixed lock delay.
