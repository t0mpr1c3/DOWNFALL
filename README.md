# DOWNFALL

Theme

Confidence is plummeting as the British economy is crashes to the ground. Exchange the falling currency before it loses all its value.

Mechanics

Simple scoring as per the [original BPS](https://tetris.wiki/Scoring), except there are no bonus points for hard drop, as only soft drop is implemented. The rotation system also is similar to the original, with the exception that the I tetromino has 4 positions rather than 2. Single preview. Wall kicks, no floor kicks, fixed lock delay.
